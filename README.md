# Saperate-and-sort-oddeven-numbers
Given a list of integers, please write a fast algorithm (with a pseudo-code or any programming language you are comfortable with) which can perform the following tasks.  separate even numbers and odd numbers. Move all even numbers to the left and move all odd numbers to the right.  sort even numbers and odd numbers respectively – in descending order.  use the input list only – do not declare another list/array. Only use swapping operation between two values.  in the input list, even numbers are a lot more than odd number; or vice versa.
